## What is this website about?

Rock Paper Scissors is a zero-sum game usually played by two people using their hands. The idea is to make shapes with an outstretched hand where each shape will have a certain degree of power and will lead to an outcome. Rock Paper Scissors is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision. In the game Rock, Paper, Scissors, two opponents randomly toss out hand gestures, and each one wins, loses or draws with equal probability. It's supposed to be a game of pure luck, not skill â€” and indeed, if humans were able to be perfectly random, no one could gain an upper hand over anyone else

## How this website is created

This website is created in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No frameworks are used for this project.

### What are the rules of RPS?
Although the game has a lot of complexity, the rules to play it are pretty simple.
The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. 3 simple rules determine the outcome of the game:

- Rock wins against scissors.
- Scissors win against the paper.
- Paper wins against the rock.

## Overview

The challenge was to build Rock, Paper, Scissors game using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The player can choose between scissors, paper, and rock, and the computer automatically selects one of the options. The results are displayed at the bottom of the board.

## UX

### User goals

- As a user, I want to be able to quickly jump into the game and start playing
- As a user, I want to be able to choose the option
- As a user, I want to have a simple interface that will lead me to my choice 
- As a user, I want to have clear and straight to point information on who won
- As a user, I want to be able to track my score 

### Developer goals

- A project that is interesting and requires some thought to code
- A site that visitors can navigate without much thought and easily
- A game that is fun and looks clean and crisp
- A game meant to feel neat and mature as to not feel infantile

### Design Choices

- The site itself needed to be easy to navigate, provide information users would find beneficial, and display said information in a way that is visually appealing.
- The colour choices were made to have a dark background with a white icon so that users don't have to strain eyes while visiting the website.
- Website is completely designed in Figma since that is my preferred UI design tool.

### UI 

The website is designed with Figma. [project can be found here](https://www.figma.com/file/mP2YD8xOhmAijP9crAWGI2/rock-paper-scissors). The design goal was to create a dark themed website so that the players/visitors do not strain their eyes when visiting the website, with big icons and good contrast for icons/options that will help users interact with the site easily and indicate when the icon is hovered or clicked. 

- The background colour is #090915 
- Icon colour: #FFFFFF
- The font is: Roboto

### Fonts

- The goal was to have a crisp and modern feel with a bit of punch.
- Font used in this website is Roboto and it was imported with help of Google Fonts.

### Icons and Colours 

Icons used for Rock, Paper and scissors are from [Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) and the colours for this project is #090915 and #FFFFFF since those 2 colours are perfect contrast and my goal was to have a nice and appealing design.
